1. How would you display the contents of a text file named "example.txt" in the terminal?

=> Ans : 'cat example.txt'
=> Explanation : 'cat' stands for concatenate. So rather than showing the file to the user what it does is reading the file from disk and sending it to the output stream.
   We can use 'cat <filename> <filename> ...' like this to show multiple files back to back 


2. What command would you use to list all files and directories in the current directory?

=> Ans : 'ls' 
=> Explanation : ls means list. 'ls -l' means long listing for more details of each file or directory.


3. How can you create a new directory named "documents" in the current directory?

=> Ans : 'mkdir documents'
=> Explanation : mkdir means make directory


4. What command would you use to copy a file named "file1.txt" from the current directory to another directory named "backup"?

=> Ans : 'cp file1.txt backup/'
=> Explanation : cp means copy, and we can use it to copy 1 or more files to destination directory.


5. How would you navigate to the parent directory of the current directory?

=> Ans : 'cd ..'
=> Explanation : cd means change directory  and '.' stnds for current directory and '..' stands for parent directory.


6. What command would you use to search for the word "apple" in a file named "fruits.txt"?

=> Ans : 'grep apple fruits.txt'
=> Explanation : grep command searches through the file and prints every line conataining the word 'apple'. Other variations of grep commands are 'grep -i ...' for case insensitive search, 'grep -c ...' for the number occurences of that word in the file, 'grep -n ...' for showing the line numbers as well.


7. How can you recursively remove a directory named "old_files" along with all its contents?

=> Ans : 'rm -r old_files'
=> Explanation : just rmdir can only remove directories if it's empty


8. What command would you use to find out the size of a file named "report.pdf" in kilobytes?

=> Ans : 'du -k report.pdf'
=> Explanation : du means disk usage. We can also use 'du -h ...' to directly see the size in redable format.


9. How can you rename a file named "oldname.txt" to "newname.txt"?

=> Ans : 'mv oldname.txt newname.txt'
=> Explanation ; mv means move. when the source and destination are the same, mv command renames a file and when they are diffrent, it moves the file to destination directory from source. We can aslo change the name of a file in another directory by using absolute/relative path.


10. What command would you use to display the last 10 lines of a file named "logfile.txt"?

=> Ans : 'tail logfile.txt'
=> Explanation : tail command by default shows last 10 lines of a file but we can see any number of lines we want by using it like this 'tail -n 50 logfile.txt'.


11. How would you create a new user named "john" on the system?

=> Ans : 'sudo useradd john'
=> Explanation : useradd or adduser creates new user account. 'sudo useradd -m <username>' to create user with home directory

=> Ans : 'sudo passwd john'
=> Explanation : passwd stands for password


13. How can you remove a user named "alice" from the system, along with their home directory and files?

=> Ans : 'sudo userdel -r alice'
=> Explanation : userdele means user dlete, -r indicates to do it recursively for every content inside


14. What command would you use to grant read and write permissions to the owner, and only read permissions to the group and others, for a file named "data.txt"?

=> Ans : 'chmod 644 data.txt'
=> Explanation : read is 4, write is 2 and execute is 1. alternatively we can use 'chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r data.txt'


15. How can you change the owner of a directory named "shared" to the user "bob" and the group "staff"?
